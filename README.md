# Scaletor

Generate modal scales and chord voices in a type safe way.

## Usage

Generating a scale for a root note and mode couldn't be easier, simply call the following:

```swift
let root = try Note("C")
let lydian = try Scaletor.makeScale(from: root, for: .lydian)
  .map(\.description)
  .joined(separator: " ")
print(lydian) // [C D E Fâ™¯ G A B]
```

Generating chords for a mode is equally easy:

```swift
let root = try Note("C")
let chords = try Scaletor.makeChords(with: root, for: MajorMode.ionian)
print(chords) // [C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, B diminished]
```
